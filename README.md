JavaScript game practice with Phaser.
I picked the most liberal license I can find. Any code in this repository, in any branch, I consider to be public domain.
You may review, copy, modify elsewhere, use in proprietary software, or any other software as you please.
This is merely a repository to help me practice game development with HTML5, using the Phaser Framework, and to learn GIT version control. Therefore I see no reason for this to be used as anything but a learning tool for myself and others.

If you choose to use this code, send me an email at arswaw@gmail.com. I'm sure I'd be interested in what you are doing.
